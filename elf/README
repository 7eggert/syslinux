SYSLINUX ELF Module Loading Support
===================================

This file will contain any relevant information regarding building, integrating
and testing ELF module loading support in SYSLINUX.


Initial Development
===================

As the ELF modules handling code matures, building and testing will be done
separately from the main SYSLINUX building flow. I have created a Makefile
target that build an user space executable that tests the ELF loading code on
a given ELF object.
